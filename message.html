    In the past year, everyone’s been talking about the lasting impact COVID-19 left on every life possible. But, as we enter the new normal, it will be imperative for us to adapt, to resist, and to conquer each hurdle just like New English Jr College did it diligently. That’s what we stand for and try to inculcate the same in our students. <br><br>
    We at New English Jr College are ready for the new world.

    <p>Dear Parents & Students <br>
    <i>“When you educate one person you can change a life, when you educate many you can change the World”</i>
 <br><br>
    
    I am hugely impressed by the commitment of the college and the staff to the provision of an excellent all-around education for our students. Education is one of the means to transmit the light of life and spread the radiance of it in the ambiance in which we live. The purpose of education is to teach our children to think and develop a capacity to reason out facts. Students should keep in mind the importance of planning and prioritizing their time and the effective use of it which are essential to achieve success. <br><br>
    Hard Work, dedication, and perseverance are the most important traits in a person that leads to success. The future belongs to you, your need, therefore, is to prepare yourself for active participation in the world. <br>
    <i>“Education’s purpose is to replace an empty mind with an Open one”</i><br>
    I wish good luck and prosperity to all.
